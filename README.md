# Hola! I'm Jade 🪴✈️

Currently living my best life studying abroad in Madrid 🇪🇸 but usually vibing in Indianapolis!

## What I do (when I'm not exploring Spain)
Human-centered AI researcher studying Informatics @ Indiana University (Class of '27). I basically talk to people, figure out what they actually need, and make tech that doesn't suck for everyone.

**The vibe:** Making AI and tech more accessible and equitable, especially for communities that usually get overlooked.

## Cool stuff I've worked on
- **Women's health research** with 50+ participants (because reproductive health tech needs way better UX)
- **Accessibility audits** with actual users with disabilities using assistive tech
- **Trauma-informed research** for nonprofits serving vulnerable communities
- Built frameworks that orgs actually use irl

## Skills that pay the bills
Research things: interviews, usability testing, accessibility audits, making sense of what people tell me

Tech things: Python, JavaScript, React, SQL, all the web dev stuff

Tools: Figma, Dovetail, Miro, WCAG 2.1

## Madrid semester (Spring '26) 🌍
Researching accessibility, GDPR, multilingual UX, and equity in public services. Also eating a concerning amount of jamón and patatas bravas.
