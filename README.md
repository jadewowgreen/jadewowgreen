**Human-Centered AI Researcher**  
Informatics @ Indiana University · Class of 2027  
Madrid, Spain (Study Abroad, Spring 2026) | Indianapolis, IN

I design and research technology that is **accessible, equitable, and human-centered**, with a focus on underserved communities. Growing up in my family’s restaurant, I learned that the best technology is often invisible—and that small, thoughtful solutions can create meaningful impact for everyone.
