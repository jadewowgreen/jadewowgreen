## design philosophy

growing up in my family's restaurant taught me that the best tech is invisible. small, thoughtful solutions make the biggest difference.

this portfolio reflects my commitment to:
- accessibility first, always
- clean, minimal design
- user needs over aesthetic trends
- inclusive and equitable experiences
