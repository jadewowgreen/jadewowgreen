# Hi there 👋

I'm **Jade (玉) Zhao** — a full-stack developer, UX designer, and someone who's really passionate about creating digital experiences that feel human and helpful. I'm currently studying Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington (graduating 2027) with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction and web development. I'm grateful to be a Hudson & Holland Scholar and have made the Dean's List a few times — it means a lot to me!

## What I've been up to

**UX Design Intern** @ Stealth Startup (Jun 2024 – Dec 2025)
Got to dive deep into user research and testing with a great group of participants. We worked together on some feature ideas that really helped boost engagement. Love building user flows and prototypes in Figma for both mobile and web!

**Digital Marketing Manager** @ Benyue (Jan 2024 – May 2024)
Team effort to improve the ordering system through user conversations and mapping out experiences. We made checkout smoother and saw some nice improvements on mobile. Got to help create a design system everyone could use easily.

**Full Stack Developer** @ New Pal Coffee Shop (May 2023 – Dec 2023)
Built a responsive e-commerce site using React and Node.js that made ordering way easier for customers. Integrated payments and helped automate a lot of the manual work. So rewarding to see it help real people every day!
