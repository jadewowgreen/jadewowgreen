## 📊 About Me

Hi! I'm Jade, a UX Researcher specializing in accessibility and community-centered design. I'm a Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar studying Information Science at Indiana University Bloomington (Class of 2027).

I enjoy conducting research with underserved communities using interviews, usability testing, participatory design, and thematic analysis. My work prioritizes user safety, privacy, and equity - especially when working with vulnerable populations.

Growing up in my family's restaurant taught me to observe what people need before they can articulate it. That foundation shapes how I approach every research project with care, from trauma-informed protocols to accessibility-first design. I believe technology should work for everyone, and I'm committed to making that happen.

Outside of research: piano, books, jade plants, and dreaming of a duck farm with unlimited matcha.

## 💼 Research Experience

**Informatics Research Undergraduate** @ Indiana University (Sep 2025 - Dec 2025)

→ Engaged with 50+ participants across 8 user segments through interviews, diary studies, and usability testing; uncovered insights through thematic analysis that shaped product strategy

→ Transformed research insights into actionable recommendations, driving 3 product pivots that increased user engagement 40%; shared compelling findings with cross-functional teams

**UX Researcher** @ Laurie Burns McRobbie Serve IT Clinic (Aug 2024 - Dec 2025)

→ Researched for 3 client organizations: Greater Bloomington Chamber of Commerce (business directory), Indiana Phenology Lab (scientific data platform), and Middle Way House (domestic violence services), each with unique user needs

→ Connected with 29 staff members and 48 end users across diverse populations (business owners, researchers, citizen scientists, domestic violence survivors); developed trauma-informed protocols prioritizing safety and dignity

→ Uncovered critical barriers through card sorting, usability testing, and accessibility audits using WCAG 2.1 guidelines: 70% difficulty in member discovery, 65% public comprehension failure, and 12 safety risks for crisis users

→ Designed information architectures and recommendations that improved task completion 40-88% across projects; increased member connections 45%, public engagement 55%, and reduced crisis resource discovery time 40%

**Digital Accessibility Intern** @ City of Bloomington (Jan 2024 - May 2024)

→ Partnered with 8 users with disabilities using assistive technologies (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) to audit 15+ municipal websites using WCAG 2.1 guidelines; learned firsthand about barriers preventing access to essential city services

→ Championed accessibility improvements, elevating compliance from 60% to 85% across audited sites; created testing protocol and documentation for sustainable impact

## 🔬 Research Projects

**Community-Centered UX Design** (Aug 2024 - Present)
Honors Thesis • Indy Local Collective

Research Question: How can technology adoption be made more equitable for underserved small businesses with limited technical literacy and resources?

Methods: Participatory workshops (n=15), semi-structured interviews, usability testing (3 rounds), thematic analysis synthesizing 150+ data points

Key Findings: (1) Time and resources were bigger barriers than technical literacy; (2) Businesses needed step-by-step guidance, not just tools; (3) Trust-building through community connections was essential; (4) Mobile-first solutions were critical for on-the-go operations

Impact: Framework adopted by 8 local businesses; informed 3 new community programs; shared findings at IU Leadership Conference

**UX Consulting Framework** (Jan 2024 - May 2024)
Capstone Project • Matcha Green Consulting

Research Question: What are the barriers preventing micro-businesses from conducting user research, and how can we lower those barriers?

Methods: Case study analysis (n=8), in-depth interviews, journey mapping workshops, framework validation with 3 businesses

Key Findings: (1) Cost and time were the biggest barriers, not lack of interest in research; (2) Businesses needed templates and step-by-step guides, not just concepts; (3) Research needed to be framed as "customer feedback" not "user research" to reduce intimidation; (4) Peer learning and community support were essential for adoption

Impact: Honorable mention at IU Leadership Conference (200+ submissions); 5 businesses successfully conducted their first user research using the toolkit
