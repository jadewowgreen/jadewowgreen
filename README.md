Human-Centered AI Researcher  
Informatics @ Indiana University · Class of 2027  
Madrid, Spain (Study Abroad, Spring 2026) | Indianapolis, IN

I research and design technology that is accessible, equitable, and human-centered, with a focus on underserved communities. My work is shaped by growing up in my family’s Chinese restaurant, where I learned that the best technology is often invisible and that small, thoughtful solutions can make a meaningful difference for everyone.

## Studying Abroad
In Spring 2026, I will be studying in Madrid, Spain through Indiana University’s program with Universidad Complutense de Madrid. I am grateful to be supported by the Luddy Study Abroad Scholarship and the Edward L. Hutton International Experiences Program (HIEP) Grant. Studying abroad represents an important step in expanding my understanding of how technology, business, and culture intersect across global contexts.
