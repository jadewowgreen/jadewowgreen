## 📊 About Me

Hi, I'm Jade, a Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar studying Information Science at Indiana University Bloomington (Class of 2027).

I research how AI can support people when designed with their needs in mind. Working with the Proactive Health Informatics Research Group and Serve IT Clinic, I focus on health informatics, accessibility, and trauma-informed research methods.

Always prioritize user safety, privacy, and equity.

Outside of research: piano, books, jade plants, dreaming of a duck farm with unlimited matcha.

## 💼 Research Experience

**Research Undergraduate** @ Proactive Health Informatics Research Group (Sep 2025 - Dec 2025)

→ Contributing to grant-supported human-centered AI research on women's reproductive health; applying user-centered design principles to investigate how AI systems can support health outcomes

→ Conducting user research with **50+ participants** across **8 user segments** using interviews, diary studies, and usability testing; analyzing findings through thematic analysis to inform product decisions

**Human-centered AI Researcher** @ Laurie Burns McRobbie Serve IT Clinic (Jun 2024 - Dec 2025)

→ Supported human-centered AI research for **3 client organizations** through Serve IT's PIT-UN Challenge grant program; collaborated with community organizations to develop AI-driven solutions addressing real-world challenges

→ Conducted research with **29 staff members and 48 end users** across diverse populations (business owners, researchers, citizen scientists, domestic violence survivors); developed trauma-informed research protocols prioritizing safety and dignity for vulnerable populations

→ Applied human-centered AI principles to identify barriers through card sorting, usability testing, and accessibility audits using WCAG 2.1 guidelines; documented challenges including member discovery difficulties, comprehension issues, and safety concerns for crisis users

→ Contributed to information architecture and AI-informed recommendations that improved task completion across projects; supported efforts to increase member connections, public engagement, and reduce resource discovery time

**Digital Accessibility Intern** @ City of Bloomington (Jan 2024 - May 2024)

→ Conducted accessibility audits with **8 users with disabilities** using assistive technologies (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) on municipal websites using WCAG 2.1 guidelines; identified barriers preventing access to city services

→ Supported accessibility improvements that increased compliance across audited sites; contributed to testing protocol and documentation for ongoing impact

## 🔬 Research Projects

**Health Informatics for Underserved Communities** (Jan 2024 - Dec 2025)
Honors Thesis • Indy Local Collective

Research Question: How can health informatics solutions informed by public health principles, prevention strategies, and stress management approaches improve healthcare access and technology adoption for underserved communities?

Methods: Participatory workshops (n=15), semi-structured interviews, usability testing (3 rounds), epidemiological analysis and thematic analysis synthesizing 150+ data points

Key Findings: (1) Social determinants of health (time, resources, access) were bigger barriers than technical literacy; (2) Prevention-focused approaches and stress management considerations were essential for sustainable health technology adoption; (3) Trust-building through community connections was critical for health intervention success; (4) Mobile-first health solutions addressing prevention and stress reduction were most effective for underserved populations

Impact: Health technology framework adopted by local organizations; informed community health programs; presented findings at IU Leadership Conference

**Human-Centered AI Consulting Framework** (Jan 2024 - Dec 2025)
Capstone Project • Matcha Green Consulting

Research Question: What are the barriers preventing micro-businesses from conducting user research?

Methods: Case study analysis (n=8), in-depth interviews, journey mapping workshops, framework validation with 3 businesses

Key Findings: (1) Cost and time were the biggest barriers, not lack of interest in research; (2) Businesses needed templates and step-by-step guides, not just concepts; (3) Research needed to be framed as "customer feedback" not "user research" to reduce intimidation; (4) Peer learning and community support were essential for adoption

Impact: Honorable mention at IU Leadership Conference; businesses used the toolkit to conduct their first user research

## 🇪🇸 Madrid Research Projects

Studying abroad in Madrid (Jan 2026 - May 2026), conducting cross-cultural UX research on accessibility standards, privacy norms, and cultural design patterns. This research fulfills requirements for the Luddy Study Abroad Scholarship, Edward L. Hutton International Experiences Program (HIEP) Grant, Hudson & Holland Scholars Program, and FASE Advisory Board. Findings will be presented at the Luddy International Fair.

**Accessibility in Madrid Public Services** (Jan 2026 - May 2026)
Independent Researcher • Comparative Accessibility Research • Madrid, Spain

Fulfills Luddy Study Abroad Scholarship requirement: Informatics research abroad

Research Question: How do European accessibility standards and implementations differ from US approaches in public services?

Methods: Observational research in public spaces (metro, museums, government buildings); documentation of accessibility features; heuristic evaluation comparing Spanish vs. US digital services; journey mapping as non-native user

Focus Areas: Physical accessibility in public transit, digital accessibility in government websites, multilingual accessibility features, wayfinding systems

Expected Insights: European accessibility innovations; design patterns for inclusive public services; cultural differences in accessibility implementation

Methods: Documentation of multilingual features in Spanish healthcare apps and websites; journey mapping as non-native Spanish speaker; analysis of translation quality and cultural context in health information; comparison with US multilingual health services

Focus Areas: Language switching in health apps, medical terminology translation, cultural sensitivity in health communication, accessibility of health information for international users

Expected Insights: Design patterns for multilingual health services; when translation is sufficient vs. when cultural adaptation is needed; best practices for inclusive health communication

**Equity in Spanish Public Service Design** (Jan 2026 - May 2026)
