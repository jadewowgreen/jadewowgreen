## 📊 About Me

Hi, I'm Jade, a Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar studying Information Science at Indiana University Bloomington (Class of 2027).

I research how AI can support people when designed with their needs in mind. Working with the Proactive Health Informatics Research Group and Serve IT Clinic, I focus on health informatics, accessibility, and trauma-informed research methods.

Always prioritize user safety, privacy, and equity.

Outside of research: piano, books, jade plants, dreaming of a duck farm with unlimited matcha.

## 💼 Research Experience

**Research Undergraduate** @ Proactive Health Informatics Research Group (Sep 2025 - Dec 2025)

→ Contributing to grant-supported human-centered AI research on women's reproductive health; exploring how AI systems can support health outcomes

→ Conducting user research with 50+ participants across 8 user segments using interviews, diary studies, and usability testing; analyzing findings through thematic analysis to inform product decisions

**Human-centered AI Researcher** @ Laurie Burns McRobbie Serve IT Clinic (Jun 2024 - Dec 2025)

→ Supported human-centered AI research for 3 client organizations through Serve IT's PIT-UN Challenge grant program; worked with community organizations to develop AI-driven solutions

→ Conducted research with 29 staff members and 48 end users across diverse populations; developed trauma-informed research protocols prioritizing safety and dignity

→ Applied human-centered AI principles to identify barriers through card sorting, usability testing, and accessibility audits using WCAG 2.1 guidelines; documented challenges including member discovery difficulties, comprehension issues, and safety concerns

→ Contributed to information architecture and AI-informed recommendations; supported efforts to improve task completion, member connections, and public engagement

**Digital Accessibility Intern** @ City of Bloomington (Jan 2024 - May 2024)

→ Conducted accessibility audits with 8 users with disabilities using assistive technologies (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) on municipal websites using WCAG 2.1 guidelines; identified barriers preventing access to city services

→ Supported accessibility improvements that increased compliance across audited sites; contributed to testing protocol and documentation for ongoing impact

## 🔬 Research Projects

**Health Informatics for Underserved Communities** (Jan 2024 - Dec 2025)
Honors Thesis • Indy Local Collective

Research Question: How can health informatics solutions informed by public health principles, prevention strategies, and stress management approaches improve healthcare access and technology adoption for underserved communities?

Methods: Participatory workshops (n=15), semi-structured interviews, usability testing (3 rounds), epidemiological analysis and thematic analysis synthesizing 150+ data points

Key Findings: (1) Social determinants of health (time, resources, access) were bigger barriers than technical literacy; (2) Prevention-focused approaches and stress management considerations were essential for sustainable health technology adoption; (3) Trust-building through community connections was critical for health intervention success; (4) Mobile-first health solutions addressing prevention and stress reduction were most effective for underserved populations

Impact: Health technology framework adopted by local organizations; informed community health programs; presented findings at IU Leadership Conference

**Human-Centered AI Consulting Framework** (Jan 2024 - Dec 2025)
Capstone Project • Matcha Green Consulting

Research Question: What are the barriers preventing micro-businesses from conducting user research, and how can we lower those barriers?

Methods: Case study analysis (n=8), in-depth interviews, journey mapping workshops, framework validation with 3 businesses

Key Findings: (1) Cost and time were the biggest barriers, not lack of interest in research; (2) Businesses needed templates and step-by-step guides, not just concepts; (3) Research needed to be framed as "customer feedback" not "user research" to reduce intimidation; (4) Peer learning and community support were essential for adoption

Impact: Honorable mention at IU Leadership Conference; businesses used the toolkit to conduct their first user research
