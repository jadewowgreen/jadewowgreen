## 📊 About Me

Hi, I'm Jade. I'm a Human-centered Artificial Intelligence Researcher at Indiana University's Luddy School, where I'm studying Information Science with a focus on Health Informatics & Human-Centered AI (Class of 2027). I'm a Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar.

I work with the Proactive Health Informatics Research Group and the Laurie Burns McRobbie Serve IT Clinic, where I'm learning how AI systems can support people when designed with their needs in mind. I've been fortunate to work with diverse populations across health tech and community organizations, and I'm continuing to learn how to approach research thoughtfully.

Growing up in my family's restaurant taught me to notice what people need, even when they don't say it directly. I try to bring that same attention to my research work. I believe technology should be accessible to everyone, and I'm working to contribute to that through careful, ethical research practices.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing piano, reading classic literature, and caring for my jade plants.

## 💼 Research Experience

**Research Undergraduate** @ Proactive Health Informatics Research Group (Sep 2025 - Dec 2025)

→ Contributing to grant-supported human-centered AI research on women's reproductive health; applying user-centered design principles to investigate how AI systems can support health outcomes

→ Conducting user research with 50+ participants across 8 user segments using interviews, diary studies, and usability testing; analyzing findings through thematic analysis to inform product decisions

**Human-centered AI Researcher** @ Laurie Burns McRobbie Serve IT Clinic (Jun 2024 - Dec 2025)

→ Supported human-centered AI research for 3 client organizations through Serve IT's PIT-UN Challenge grant program; collaborated with community organizations to develop AI-driven solutions addressing real-world challenges

→ Conducted research with 29 staff members and 48 end users across diverse populations (business owners, researchers, citizen scientists, domestic violence survivors); developed trauma-informed research protocols prioritizing safety and dignity for vulnerable populations

→ Applied human-centered AI principles to identify barriers through card sorting, usability testing, and accessibility audits using WCAG 2.1 guidelines; documented challenges including member discovery difficulties, comprehension issues, and safety concerns for crisis users

→ Contributed to information architecture and AI-informed recommendations that improved task completion across projects; supported efforts to increase member connections, public engagement, and reduce resource discovery time

**Digital Accessibility Intern** @ City of Bloomington (Jan 2024 - May 2024)

→ Conducted accessibility audits with 8 users with disabilities using assistive technologies (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) on municipal websites using WCAG 2.1 guidelines; identified barriers preventing access to city services

→ Supported accessibility improvements that increased compliance across audited sites; contributed to testing protocol and documentation for ongoing impact

## 🔬 Research Projects

**Health Informatics for Underserved Communities** (Jan 2024 - Dec 2025)
Honors Thesis • Indy Local Collective

Research Question: How can health informatics solutions informed by public health principles, prevention strategies, and stress management approaches improve healthcare access and technology adoption for underserved communities?

Methods: Participatory workshops (n=15), semi-structured interviews, usability testing (3 rounds), epidemiological analysis and thematic analysis synthesizing 150+ data points

Key Findings: (1) Social determinants of health (time, resources, access) were bigger barriers than technical literacy; (2) Prevention-focused approaches and stress management considerations were essential for sustainable health technology adoption; (3) Trust-building through community connections was critical for health intervention success; (4) Mobile-first health solutions addressing prevention and stress reduction were most effective for underserved populations

Impact: Health technology framework adopted by 8 local organizations; informed 3 new community health programs; presented findings at IU Leadership Conference

**Human-Centered AI Consulting Framework** (Jan 2024 - Dec 2025)
Capstone Project • Matcha Green Consulting

Research Question: What are the barriers preventing micro-businesses from conducting user research, and how can we lower those barriers?

Methods: Case study analysis (n=8), in-depth interviews, journey mapping workshops, framework validation with 3 businesses

Key Findings: (1) Cost and time were the biggest barriers, not lack of interest in research; (2) Businesses needed templates and step-by-step guides, not just concepts; (3) Research needed to be framed as "customer feedback" not "user research" to reduce intimidation; (4) Peer learning and community support were essential for adoption

Impact: Honorable mention at IU Leadership Conference (200+ submissions); 5 businesses successfully conducted their first user research using the toolkit
