# Hi there 👋

I'm **Jade (玉) Zhao** — a full-stack developer, UX designer, and someone who's really passionate about creating digital experiences that feel human and helpful. I'm currently studying Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington (graduating 2027) with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction and web development. I'm grateful to be a Hudson & Holland Scholar and have made the Dean's List a few times — it means a lot to me!

**Digital Marketing Manager** @ Benyue (Jan 2024 – May 2024)
Team effort to improve the ordering system through user conversations and mapping out experiences. We made checkout smoother and saw some nice improvements on mobile. Got to help create a design system everyone could use easily.

**Full Stack Developer** @ New Pal Coffee Shop (May 2023 – Dec 2023)
Built a responsive e-commerce site using React and Node.js that made ordering way easier for customers. Integrated payments and helped automate a lot of the manual work. So rewarding to see it help real people every day!

## Projects I'm excited about

Working with local businesses to make digital spaces more accessible for everyone. We're doing interviews, testing, and workshops together to create solutions that actually help people. Learning so much about equity and collaboration!

**UX Consulting Methodology** (Capstone Project)
Developed a simple toolkit to help small businesses think through their user experience. Created templates and guidelines that other entrepreneurs can use. Got to facilitate at the IU Leadership Conference — such a fun experience!

## Fun fact

I tried teaching my jade plant chess once. It didn't go well, but we're still friends. (I think it's holding a grudge though!)
